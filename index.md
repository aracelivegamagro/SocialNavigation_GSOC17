## Social Navigation
My project for GSOC'17 has consisted in Social Navigation. The main goal has been giving mobile robots the capacity of behaving in a social acceptable manner.

To achieve this aim, in first place, the personal space of humans has been modelled, wich has allowed the robot to respect their personal space. 

The humans present in the environment has been clustered according to their distances in order to avoid the robot interfering between interacting humans.

It has been necessary to modify the navigation architecture to allow the robot to recognize the personal space of the individuals and the different groups of people.

Once this work was done, it was required to fix different bugs in the code that prevented the progress in the development. That has prevented to achieve all the goals set. Also, parts of the code were improved in order to make it more efficient. 

Finally, a new method that allows the robot to recognize if humans are interacting with objects was created.
